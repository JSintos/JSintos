<h1 align="center"> Hi there! My name's Joshua Sintos :grin: </h1>

I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer disguised as a full-time college student. Interests include creating solutions to problems, web development, and learning new things. I spend a lot of my spare time playing video games, learning how to cook dishes other than fried rice, and attempting to fix my body clock.
